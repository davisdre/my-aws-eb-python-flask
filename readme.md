# My AWS Beanstalk Flask

As I'm studying for my AWC Cloud practitioner exam I came I like do some hands on projects. I've converted my Open Weather project to Python and deploying it to AWS Beanstalk. 

## My take aways
1. Learned about Python.
2. The [EB CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html) makes it really easy to spin up and destroy.
3. AWS doesn't have the best of GitHub Actions but there is enough marketplace actions to get it to work.
4. The AWS CLI makes it really easy to deploy new AWS Beanstalk application versions.

## What I've added to this project
- I've added this to GitHub.
- I've added GitHub actions to help with continus deployment, so every time you make a change it creates a new version of your application.
