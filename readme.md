# My AWS Beanstalk Flask

As I'm studying for my AWC Cloud practitioner exam I came across this [tutorial from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-flask.html). These hands on project help me with understanding the service(s) and putting it into practice. This also helps with learning the CLI of those services as well. 

## My take aways
1. Learned about Python.
2. The [EB CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html) makes it really easy to spin up and destroy.
3. AWS doesn't have the best of GitHub Actions but there is enough marketplace actions to get it to work.
4. The AWS CLI makes it really easy to deploy new AWS Beanstalk application versions.

## What I've added to this project
- I've added this to GitHub.
- I've added GitHub actions to help with continus deployment, so every time you make a change it creates a new version of your application.
